The blog is about the enrollment in degree-granting historically Black colleges and universities.  We have an analysis of gender-wise enrollment in the overall programme's and bachelor's programme.


```{r}
library(tidyverse) # metadata of packages
theme_set(theme_light())
```

```{r}
hbcu_all <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2021/2021-02-02/hbcu_all.csv')
```

## Institute Enrollment According to Gender?

```{r}
hbcu_all %>%
  pivot_longer(c(Males, Females), names_to = "Gender", values_to = "total_gender") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, total_gender)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = Gender), position = "dodge") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, colour="#333333") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FAAB18", "#1380A1")) +
  labs(y = "",
       x = "Years",
       fill = "",
       title = "HBCU Enrollment") +
    theme(
      legend.position = "top",
      plot.title = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 20, 
                                face = "bold", color = "#222222"), 
      plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 18, 
                                   margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)),
      axis.text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 10,
                               color = "#222222"),
      legend.text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 12,
                               color = "#222222"),
      panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="#cbcbcb"), 
      panel.grid.major.y=element_blank()) 
```


Looks like females enrolled more into institutes than Males. How many enrollement happended compare to males all this years?


## Ratio of Enrollment?

```{r}
hbcu_all %>%
  select(Males, Females, `Total enrollment`) %>%
  summarise(total_males = sum(Males),total_females = sum(Females), 
            total_enrol = sum(`Total enrollment`)) %>%
  mutate(ratio_males = total_males/total_enrol, ratio_females = total_females/total_enrol) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(ratio_males, ratio_females), names_to = "gender", values_to = "count") %>%
  ggplot(aes("", count)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = gender)) +
  coord_polar(theta = "y", start = 0) +
  geom_text(aes(label = round(count, 2)), position = position_stack(vjust = 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FAAB18", "#1380A1"), labels = c("Females", "Males")) +
  labs(y = "",
       fill = "",
       title = "Overall Enrollment Ratio") +
    theme(
      legend.position = "top",
      plot.title = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 20, 
                                face = "bold", color = "#222222"), 
      plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 18, 
                                   margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)),
      axis.text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 10,
                               color = "#222222"),
      legend.text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 12,
                               color = "#222222")) 
```

Out of Total Students Enrolled in institutes almost 60% are females.


## Bachelors Degree Enrollments?

We know that 60% of them are females. So if we find 60% of the `4-year` (Bachelor's programme) we might get a rough estimate of females enrolled in that programme.


```{r}
hbcu_all %>%
  mutate(females_bachelors = `4-year`*0.6, males_bachelors= `4-year`*0.4) %>%
  pivot_longer(c(females_bachelors, males_bachelors), 
               names_to = "gender_bachelors", values_to = "count_bachelors") %>%
  ggplot(aes(Year, count_bachelors)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = gender_bachelors), position = "dodge") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, size = 1, colour="#333333") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("#FAAB18", "#1380A1"),  labels = c("Females", "Males")) +
  labs(y = "",
       x = "Years",
       fill = "",
       title = "Students Enrolled in Bachelor's Programme") +
    theme(
      legend.position = "top",
      plot.title = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 20, 
                                face = "bold", color = "#222222"), 
      plot.subtitle = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 18, 
                                   margin = margin(9, 0, 9, 0)),
      axis.text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 10,
                               color = "#222222"),
      legend.text = element_text(family = "Helvetica", size = 12,
                               color = "#222222"),
      panel.grid.major.x = element_line(color="#cbcbcb"), 
      panel.grid.major.y=element_blank()) 
```



We can cross-check the details with this [Article](https://nces.ed.gov/fastfacts/display.asp?id=667) 
(**Note**: The article is based on 2018 data, But it is a good estimate for our data (1976-2015))

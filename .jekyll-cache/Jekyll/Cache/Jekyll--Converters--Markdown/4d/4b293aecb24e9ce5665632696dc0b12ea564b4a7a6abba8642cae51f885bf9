I"⁄<p>Welcome to Wintersession 1015, <strong>Intermediate Data Science Using R</strong>. The course takes place from <strong>1/26-30, 11AM-12PM, in McCosh 4</strong>.</p>

<p>Please make sure to complete the following <em>before</em> coming to lecture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bring a <strong>fully charged laptop</strong>,</li>
  <li><strong>Install the latest version of R</strong> (3.1.2), which can be done <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/">here</a>. If you already have R installed, make sure your version is <strong>at least 3.1.2</strong>.</li>
  <li><strong>Install RStudio</strong>, which can be found <a href="http://www.rstudio.com/">here</a>. <em>Make sure you can open the application,</em> and have it ready at the start of the session.</li>

<p>These notes go over the code and figures used in the lectures. Note that they‚Äôre written to guide my lectures rather than to learn from by themselves. (There is also no guarantee that these notes will be available for all lectures).</p>

<p><strong>NOTE: Due to the blizzard, Tuesday‚Äôs lecture was canceled. The second lecture will instead be given Wednesday; I am still working on scheduling the remaining classes.</strong></p>

<p>While you‚Äôre encouraged to attend every session, you may be able to skip a session that you‚Äôre particularly familiar with. Similarly, if you have friends that are interested in one topic, but not others, they should feel free to visit just that one session (I won‚Äôt tell if you don‚Äôt).</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Monday: Tidy Data Manipulation I</strong>: In this class we‚Äôll teach the <a href="http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html">dplyr</a> package for filtering, merging, and manipulating data with concise syntax. This serves as an introduction to the powerful and popular <a href="http://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.pdf">‚Äútidy data‚Äù framework</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Wednesday: Tidy Data Manipulation II</strong>: How do you turn messy data tidy, and how do you keep it that way? We‚Äôll learn to use the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/tidyr">tidyr</a> package to manipulate the structure of data so it can be analyzed using dplyr and plotted using ggplot2. We‚Äôll also learn to use the <a href="https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom">broom</a> package, which takes many kinds of statistical model objects and turns them into tidy data frames that can be manipulated within this framework.</li>
  <li><strong>TBA: Reproducible Research</strong>: Suppose you‚Äôve just finished your manuscript, presentation, or homework assignment based on an R analysis. But then you change your R code in a way that <strong>slightly</strong> changes your results- and now you have to go back and replace all of your text, your tables, and your figures- what a hassle! The <a href="http://yihui.name/knitr/">knitr</a> package solves this, by integrating your code into the same document as your report. <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/">R Markdown</a>, meanwhile, lets you format these reports into HTML, PDFs, Word documents, or presentations. You‚Äôll have the option of displaying your R code in the document right next to the results (useful for assignments and tutorials) or hiding it (useful for manuscripts and presentations).</li>
  <li><strong>TBA: Package Development</strong>: Once you‚Äôve developed some statistical methods in R, you might want to share your code with the larger community. The most powerful way you can share it is as an R package (just like the ones we‚Äôve learned this week). We‚Äôll go over the steps of creating an R package from scratch. You‚Äôll start with a basic skeleton using the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/devtools">devtools</a> package, document your code with <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/index.html">Roxygen2</a>, and write unit tests with <a href="http://journal.r-project.org/archive/2011-1/RJournal_2011-1_Wickham.pdf">testthat</a>. We‚Äôll then show how to publish your code on GitHub, and go over how one would submit it to CRAN (the official R package network).</li>
  <li><strong>TBA: Web Scraping</strong>: Not all data that you want to analyze and visualize comes in neat tab-delimited files- some might be on web pages, in the form of tables and text. We‚Äôll learn how to use the <a href="https://github.com/hadley/rvest">rvest</a> package to download and parse (‚Äúscrape‚Äù) this content so it can be analyzed in R, using examples like the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</a> (IMDb).</li>

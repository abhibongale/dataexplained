Statistical modelling is an art of deduction.

I grew up playing chess, which helps to learn how to hold complexity in mind and still make excellent decisions. The game thought me about how attention for spotting a hidden detail could guarantee victory while missing it could lead to inexorable defeat. While much of chess thinking has a narrative quality, this seeking called for the logic of calculation. Itâ€™s about keeping track of the balance of material forces as they attempt to eliminate each other in a battle for supremacy. To make great chess moves, you need to see the whole position in all its reverberating dynamism. It is a game of deduction moves with proper attention to details to spot future move to gain an advantage.

In recent years, I have worked in academic projects, attempting to integrate our understanding of complex societal challenges. And solving these complex challenges embark me into a journey of statistics and artificial intelligence. In this journey, I learned that AI is just like chess its an art of deduction of complex challenges.

My love for solving intriguing problems bought me more close to mathematics, programming, modelling. It oddly satisfies me when I solve complex problems using statistical modelling or neural networks. It helps me to keep my creativity intact.

My specialities include quick learning of new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, statistical modelling, problem-framing, neural networks, data visualization, data mining, statistics. So far, I have R, SQL, Core Java, Python, Git/Github, Linux, under my belt. I am still enthusiastically grabbing new concepts, learning new frameworks.
